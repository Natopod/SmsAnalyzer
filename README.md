# SmsAnalyzer

This is the first run of the SMS Analyzer app for android. Next revision will include an update to the individual analysis reports
rather than having them all in one list view the app will allow the user to select a given contact then only recieve data on 
the contact they selected. 

Refactoring the entire code base will take place soon as well once the analysis code is refined somewhat.

Current functionality:

-Total user message stats
-Averages of key messsaging details
-Message stats broken down by contact number

Stats include:
-# of messages
-# of people that sent an SMS to the user
-average message length
-sent/received ratio
-word counts
-profanity rating
-love rating
-help rating

Future additions:
-social media
-individual contact profiles
-top 5 friends
-better graphics and transitions
